# List of Data Science Competition Platforms

Data Science and Machine Learning Competitions are useful and interesting ways to study, learn and test ML algorithms on real problems. This is a listing of different websites and platforms that are used to organize DS/ML competitions in the world. Enjoy.

I created this list with the help of several people in the Data Hackers community (Special thanks to Grandmaster Gilberto and Mario Filho), I hope it will be helpful. Please help me keep this post up-to-date by submitting corrections and additions via pull-request, or joined in https://datahackers.com.br/.
